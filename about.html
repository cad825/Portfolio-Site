            I’ll cut straight to my biggest weakness: I’m not a good dining companion. This isn’t due to a lack of manners. I chew with my mouth closed, keep my elbows off the table, and place the napkin in my lap. It’s because there’s a very high
            likelihood I'll discover at least one hair in the food. No matter how painstakingly discreet I attempt to be while removing this discovery, there’s still a chance you may notice; resulting in a loss of appetite and ruined meal. This
            scenario plays out all too often for me.

            Why am I telling you this? Is it because I shed hair like a golden retriever? No. We’re talking about hairs that are very clearly not mine. Hairs that are too long. Hairs that are different colors from my own. Hairs that are baked deep
            into the cheese of a pizza. You get the idea.

            I’m telling you this because I pay extraordinary attention to detail. If something is wrong or out of place, I'll spot it no matter how microscopic it may be.

            Now for some of my strengths. Tens of thousands of products featuring my design work have been sold to consumers online and in retail stores. I’ve designed advertisements, both print and digital, that garnered millions of impressions.
            My abilities are proven in a wide variety of project types for companies of all sizes in different industries, from household names to small one-man operations.

            These accomplishments are a result of my attention to detail, creativity, determination, and experience. I look forward to the opportunity of discussing how my strengths can help you meet your design needs.
